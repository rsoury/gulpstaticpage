## Static Page Boilerplate

This repo is just a boilerplate that allows you to easily begin developing static pages that are powered by Gulp. This boilerplate allows for use of ES6, Jade, Stylus and Browser-Sync for live reloading/injecting. Static pages can be hosted nearly anywhere which is awesome and this repo also contains the .gitlab-ci.yml file to allow for free static hosting on Gitlab. I like Gitlab pages becuase it is really easy to add SSL. Be sure to only push the dist folder to static web hosting repos.

## Code Example

In this repo to use:
```HTML
gulp dev
<!-- OR -->
gulp
webpack
```
