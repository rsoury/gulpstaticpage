## Static Page Boilerplate

This repo is just a boilerplate that allows you to easily begin developing static pages that are powered by Gulp. This boilerplate allows for use of ES6, Jade, Stylus and Browser-Sync for live reloading/injecting. Static pages can be hosted nearly anywhere which is awesome and this repo also contains the .gitlab-ci.yml file to allow for free static hosting on Gitlab. I like Gitlab pages becuase it is really easy to add SSL. Be sure to only push the dist folder to static web hosting repos.

## Code Example

In this repo to use:
```HTML
<pre>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>For Browser-Sync</h2>
        <div class="wrap">
            gulp dev
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Individual actions</h2>
        <div class="wrap">
            gulp
        </div>
        <div class="wrap">
            webpack
        </div>
    </div>
</pre>
```
